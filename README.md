# Minio Put

A couple of helper scripts to upload files to [minio](https://www.minio.io/).

The python scripts can be imported into your project and used
by calling the `upload` function.

## Python

`minio-put.py` has no external dependencies (like `six`) so that's why
there are two separate versions.
